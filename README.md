chipmachine
===========

A portable C++ music player and 'framework'

## Building the main application (Linux/Debian)

All required packages (hopefully);

	# sudo apt-get install git g++ libao-dev libfreetype6-dev libpng12-dev libasound2-dev libglfw-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libglew-dev fftw-dev

For UADE support;

	# git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/heikkiorsila/bencode-tools
	# cd bencode-tools ; ./configure ; make ; sudo make-install ; cd ..
	# git clone --depth 1 git://zakalwe.fi/uade
	# cd uade ; ./configure --prefix=/usr ; make -j8 ; sudo make-install ; cd ..

Chipmachine binary;

	# git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sasq64/cpp-mods.git
	# git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sasq64/chipmachine.git
	# git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sasq64/demofx.git
	# cd chipmachine
	# make -j8

## Using the application

* Type words separated by spaces for incremental search
* ENTER to play, *SHIFT-ENTER* to enque
* *F1* = Player screen, *F2* = Search screen
* *F6* = Next Song
* *ESC* = Clear search field
* *F8* = Clear playlist
* *F7* = Toggle Favorite
* *F9* = Save playlist to server

## Configuring the application

* Start with *-w* for window mode or *-d* for debug output
* Checkout `lua/screen.lua` for GUI layout

## Raspberry PI notes

* Building on the PI takes at least 45 minutes compared to about 1 minute cross compiling from a normal PC
* Database and index are generated on first start which may take some time

## For developers

* Look at the minimal player in `miniplay/` to see how the plugin interface works.
* Build it with make -f miniplay.mk
